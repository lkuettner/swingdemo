/**
 * The services package centers around the <code>BusinessServices</code>
 * interface linking server and clients and introduced to enable lean clients,
 * and also provides the model side of the application-wide
 * model-view-controller (MVC) framework in the
 * form of the <code>ContractorManager</code>. Server and client exchange
 * records as <code>Contractor</code> objects rather than
 * <code>String</code> arrays; so the <code>Contractor</code> class is also
 * defined in the scope of the services package.
